# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Rails follows an MVC pattern. What does that mean? 

  Your answer: Models, views and controllers are different types of directories in rails. 

  Researched answer: There is an application directory in rails that holds, models, views, and controllers. 
  
  
  Rails has an application directory called app/ with three subdirectories: models, views, and controllers. This is the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which enforces a separation between business logic from the input and presentation logic associated with a graphical user interface (GUI).



2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: A relational database is one that is separately connected with other applications

  Researched answer:

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. ... The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.


3. What is object-relational mapping?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:

Object–relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object–relational mapping, although some programmers opt to construct their own ORM tools.

4. What is a gem?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:

  RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them. It was created by Chad Fowler, Jim Weirich, David Alan Black, Paul Brannan and Richard Kilmer during RubyConf 2004.[2]



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: In a key/value pair, a primary key indicates the object that the value belongs to. 

  Researched answer:

A primary key is a field or set of fields with values that are unique throughout a table. Values of the key can be used to refer to entire records, because each record has a different value for the key. Each table can only have one primary key.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes:

A RESTful route is a route that provides mapping from HTTP verbs (get, post, put, delete, patch) to controller CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete). Instead of relying solely on the URL to indicate what site to visit, a RESTful route depends on the HTTP verb and the URL.

2. JSON:

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

3. ERB:
erb stands for "Embedded RuBy". A .html.erb or .erb.html file is HTML with Ruby code embedded in; Rails will evaluate the Ruby to add content to the file dynamically, and will output a "pure" HTML file for rendering.

4. Params:
Params in Ruby on Rails is a hash. It is the collection of data received by the application during a particular HTTP request. The data may be obtained from different sources such as links, form submissions, and redirects. 

5. API:
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.
